            Lane cake, also known as prize cake or Alabama Lane cake, is a four-layer white cake with a bourbon-spiked raisin filling that
            originated in the American South. It's the official state cake of Alabama.
            <br>
            The base for Lane cake is a variation of the old-fashioned 1-2-3-4 cake (a classic cake recipe with one cup of butter, two cups
             of sugar, three cups of flour, and four eggs) that calls exclusively for eight egg whites instead of four whole eggs. This 
             results in a spongier texture. <br>
            The boozy filling traditionally contains egg yolks, sugar, butter, raisins, bourbon, and vanilla. Modern versions frequently 
            feature pecans and coconut flakes.
