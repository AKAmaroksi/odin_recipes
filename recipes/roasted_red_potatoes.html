            Roasted red potatoes are a delicious side dish that pairs well with a variety of main courses. They're easy to make and require minimal ingredients. <br>
            To make roasted red potatoes, start by preheating your oven to 400°F (200°C). Wash and scrub the potatoes, then cut them into bite-sized pieces. Toss the potatoes with olive oil, salt, pepper, and any other seasonings you like. Spread the potatoes in a single layer on a baking sheet and roast for 30-40 minutes, or until they're golden brown and crispy on the outside. <br>
            Serve the roasted red potatoes hot as a side dish with your favorite meal. They're sure to be a hit with your family and friends!
